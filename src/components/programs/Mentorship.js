/********* UPDATING MENTORSHIP PAGE CONTENT FOR THE NEW SEMESTER *********
  Important Note: It is best to update this page's contents once
                  the design team has provided the flyers
  1. If you don't have access to firestore, ask the Web Master to follow
    this step.

    Instruction: Update the "mentorship" collection in the firebase.
    In the Firebase -> Firestore Database -> mentorship collection,
    - add new document with the following fields:
    - flyer, season, videoLink
    - if flyer and/or videoLink is unavailable, leave it blank

  2. If the current program is Mentorship, leave the description as it is.
    However, if current semester has different type of program for example
    PRO-DEV workshop, then feel free to change the description
    *Mentorship default description is at the bottom page*
  3. Adding icons:
    - feel free to add topics/skills that are necessary to the current program
    - refer to https://icons.getbootstrap.com/ to find icons
    - Simply add your icons with this format:
    - <Icon.IconName className="icon" />
  4. Sign-up button:
    - if the sign up link is provided paste the link at the Button element
    - then simply uncomment the Button element
